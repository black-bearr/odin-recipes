        <h1>Cottage Pie</h1>
        <img src="../images/cottage-pie.jpg" alt="A delicious meat and potato pie" style="width:256px;height:256px">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cottage pie (not to be confused with shepherds pie) is made with beef mince as opposed to shepherds pie's lamb mince. There's quite a contentious claim that cottage pie originally had sliced potato on top (as opposed to mashed potato as in shepherds pie) to represent shingles on the roof of a cottage. Shepherds pie has likewise always had mashed potato to reference the wool of the lamb.</p>
        <p>Originating in the United Kingdom (but also popular in Ireland) it's made with beef mince and sliced or mashed potato, though with more of a modern twist many have taken to adding additional ingredients such as vegetables, lentils, beans, with or in place of the meat and topping with cheese. It's baked in a pie pan, uncovered to either melt the cheese or brown the potatoes. A little side note according to the Oxford Companion to Food, Scotland used to make its shepherds pie with pastry instead of mashed potatoes.</p>

        <h2>Making Cottage Pie Step By Step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan and fry 1 1/4kg beef mince until browned - you may need to do this in batches. Set aside as it browns.</li>
            <li>Put the other 2tbsp olive oil into the pan, add 2 finely chopped onions, 3 chopped carrots and 3 chopped celery sticks and cook on a gentle heat until soft, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 2 finely chopped garli cloves, 3tbsp plain flour and 1tbsp tomato puree, increase the heat and cook for a few minutes, then return the beef to the pan.</li>
            <li>Pour over a large glass of red wine, if using, and boil to reduce it slightly before adding the 850ml beef stock, 4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, a few thyme sprigs and 2 bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 45 minutes. By this time the gravy should be thick and coating the meat. Check after about 30 minutes - if a lot of liquid remains, incrase the heat slightly to reduce the gravy a little. Season well, then discard the bay leaves and thyme sticks.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the mash. In a large saucepan, cover the 1.8kg potatoes which you've peeled and chopped, in salted cold water, bring to the boil and simmer until tender.</li>
            <li>Drain well, then allow to steam-dry for a few minutes. Mash well with the 225ml milk, 25g butter, and three-quarters of the 200g strong cheddar cheese, then season with freshly grated nutmeg and some salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Spoon the meat into 2 ovenproof dishes. Pipe or spoon on the mash to cover. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>If eating straight away, heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and cook for 25-30 minutes, or until the topping is golden.
            </li>
            <li>If you want to use a slow cooker, brown your mince in batches then tip into your slow cooker and stir in the vegetables, flour, puree, wine, stock, Worcestershire sauce and herbs with some seasoning. Cover and cook on High for 4-5 hours. Make the mash following the previous steps, and then oven cook in the same way to finish.</li>
