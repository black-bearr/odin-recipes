        <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg" alt="A delicious piece of Lasagna" style="width:256px;height:256px">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of the most widely reviewed and beloved lasagna recipes in existance on the internet today, with not a single one star review and that's including operator error. Submitted by a Mr. John Chandler over twenty years ago, he had no idea just how popular it would become. Unfortunately the creator of it suddenly passed away in 2022, at the age of 53, but his name is cemented in culinary history as the best lasagna in the world.</p>
        <p>The preparation of the lasagna is the most time consuming part as the cook time is approx. 30-45 minutes depending on how thick you make the dish. The preparation and putting together of the lasagna will take around an hour, again depending on the thickness of your desired lasagna; you will also cook the lasagna for half the time covered with a piece of foil, and the other half without.
